# My-Social-Media
In this project, I developed a skeleton of a social media application which is a full-stack MERN application 
by building a backend with MongoDB, Express, and Node and adding a React Frontend.

In the backend, I implemented a user model for storing user data, implemented with Mongoose; user API endpoints 
to perform CRUD operations; and user auth for protected routes.

In the frontend, I added a working React frontend, including frontend routing and basic server-side rendering 
of the React views.

Next step, I will build a fully-featured social media application.
